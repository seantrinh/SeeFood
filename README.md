# SeeFood
Is it a hot dog? Or is it not a hot dog?

## About
From HBO's Silicon Valley, the SeeFood app is able to distinguish between photos of hot dogs and photos of things that are not hot dogs. This is my attempt at recreating the backend components of the app, primarily the model that makes predictions, using Python and machine learning frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow.

## Acknowledgements
The data used to train and test this model was downloaded from Kaggle's Hot Dog - Not Hot Dog Competition. This data was also extracted from the Food 101 dataset.

## Accuracy

The most recent model produced a test accuracy of **76%**.
